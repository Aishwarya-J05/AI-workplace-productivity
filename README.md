## 📖 Overview

**BurnoutIQ** is a machine learning-powered HR analytics tool that predicts an employee's **burnout risk score** (0–10) based on workplace productivity metrics, workload patterns, and well-being indicators.

The app helps HR teams and managers identify at-risk employees early — before burnout escalates — so they can take timely, data-driven action.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern workplaces face a growing burnout crisis. Traditional HR approaches rely on annual surveys or manager intuition, which are slow and often miss early warning signs.

This project addresses:

- How do AI tool adoption, workload, collaboration patterns, and well-being influence burnout?
- Can we build an ML model that predicts burnout risk from employee-level data?
- Can this be deployed as a usable, real-time tool for HR teams?

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔮 **Instant Burnout Score Prediction** — enter 13 employee metrics and get a risk score (0–10) in seconds
- 🟢🟡🔴 **Risk Level Classification** — automatically categorized as Low, Moderate, or High risk
- 💡 **Actionable Recommendations** — each result includes a tailored HR action recommendation
- 📊 **Visual Score Bar** — animated progress bar showing risk intensity
- ♻️ **Reset to Defaults** — one-click reset to run a fresh prediction
- 🌙 **Dark Professional UI** — clean, modern design built for HR dashboards
- 📱 **Responsive Layout** — works on desktop and tablet

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Regression — Burnout Risk Score

Predicts a continuous burnout score from 0 to 10.

| Model | MAE | MSE | R² Score |
|-------|-----|-----|----------|
| Linear Regression | — | — | baseline |
| KNN Regressor | — | — | — |
| **Random Forest (Tuned)** | **best** | **best** | **best** ✅ |

**Best Model: Random Forest Regressor** (selected via GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation)

Preprocessing pipeline:
1. Drop `Employee_ID`
2. Ordinal encode `deadline_pressure_level` (Low=0, Medium=1, High=2)
3. One-hot encode `job_role` (drop_first=True)
4. StandardScaler on all numeric features
5. Train/test split: 80/20

### Classification — Burnout Risk Level

Predicts Low / Medium / High burnout category.

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | — | — | — | — |
| Naive Bayes | — | — | — | — |
| Decision Tree | — | — | — | — |
| KNN Classifier | — | — | — | — |
| **SVM (RBF, Tuned)** | **best** | **best** | **best** | **best** ✅ |

**Best Model: SVM with RBF kernel** (tuned via GridSearchCV Pipeline)

## 🖥️ App Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Fill in Employee Details
The app is divided into 3 input sections:

- **👤 Employee Profile** — Job role, experience, deadline pressure, work-life balance
- **⏱ Weekly Time Allocation** — AI tool usage, manual work, meetings, collaboration, learning, focus hours
- **📊 Performance Indicators** — Tasks automated, error rate, task complexity

### Step 2 — Click "Predict Burnout Risk Score"
The Random Forest model runs instantly and returns:

- A **numeric score** (e.g., `6.84 / 10`)
- A **color-coded risk level** (🟢 Low / 🟡 Moderate / 🔴 High)
- An **animated fill bar** showing intensity
- A **recommended HR action** based on the risk level

### Step 3 — Reset & Predict Again
Click **↺ Reset to Defaults** to clear all fields and run a new prediction from scratch.
